Welcome to the Firebirds repository!

The following files are for the website we made for the Oconee Country Fire Rescue

On the Members page you will see two forms, one allows you to add a member and the other lets 
you add certifications for existing members. There is also an edit member form that pops up when you
hit the button next to each of the members. The form is filled out with the values that the member 
currently has.

The Certifications page is very similar it has an add certification form and also has an edit button
next to each of the certificates that makes another form pop up just like on the members page.

On the Member List page you are able to sort the table by any of the headings.
